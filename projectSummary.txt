AI CONTENT ANALYZER - PROJECT EXPLANATION

This is a simple web application that reads documents and tells you what's in them.

HOW IT WORKS:

1. You upload a PDF file or an image (like a screenshot of text)
2. The app extracts all the text from it
3. It sends that text to Google's AI (Gemini)
4. The AI reads it and gives you a short summary

TECHNICAL PARTS:

Frontend (what you see):
- Built with Next.js and React
- Has a drag-and-drop area where you upload files
- Shows you the extracted text and the AI summary
- Clean interface with visual feedback when you drag files

Backend (what does the work):
- Python with FastAPI framework
- Uses pdfplumber library to read PDFs and extract text
- Uses Tesseract OCR to read text from images and screenshots
- Connects to Google Gemini API for generating the AI summary
- Handles file validation and error management

WHY THIS IS USEFUL:

Instead of reading a long document, you can just upload it and get the main points in a few seconds. Good for research papers, articles, receipts, scanned documents, or any text you need to understand quickly.

The whole thing runs locally on your computer - frontend on port 3000, backend on port 8000. You need a free Gemini API key to make it work.
